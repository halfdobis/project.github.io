        For software developers and programmers, <br>
     we could agree that your codes, programs and <br>
      applications  are all built on a hardware <br>
       device and work its best depending on how <br>
       reputable your hardware components are. <br>
   Hardware is very important to software <br>
    as much as software is to hardware so,<br>
     it could be said that  they work well <br>
     with each other.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span class="badge badge-secondary">HOW TO DIAGNOSE A DESKTOP</span></h2> 
    <img src="cs.jpg" alt="destop device">
    <p>
        <pre style="font-size:large; font-family: verdana;">
  Desktop can be <em>very easy</em> to diagnose unlike a laptop. 
  But this depends on what is happening to your computer desktop.
  Let us start with the usual problem which is "SYSTEM NOT COMING ON".
  When a computer desktop is not coming on, it could mean a whole lot of things. 
  You cannot just say your mother board is faulty or your power button is bad.
  If you do not know what to do, you could try the following steps before 
  taking your computer to go see an engineer.
    </pre>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-size:x-large;color: red; ">Plug in your Desktop.</li> <br>
        <p>
            <pre style="font-size: large;">
    Lay your CPU on its side and open it up, the plug it in.
    When your desktop is successfully connected to electricity,
    there is a green light indicator on your mother board showing
    there's power. If that light indicator is not on, you may have 
    try another cable. If you try another cable and there's still
    no light indicator, the mother board maybe bad and in this case,
    see an engineer right away. But if there is, then you move on to
    the next step. 
            </pre>
        </p> <br>
        <li style="font-size: x-large;color: red; ">Switch on your Desktop.</li>
        <br>
        <p>
            <pre style="font-size: large;">
    Here, when you press the power button of your CPU, your 
    desktop is set to power up instantly. But, in a case whereby 
    it doesn't, if the light indicator of your CPU blinks three
    to four times, then the problem is most likely to be from 
    your RAM. But, if the blinking is non-stop or more than six,
    then it's most likely the mother board is bad.
